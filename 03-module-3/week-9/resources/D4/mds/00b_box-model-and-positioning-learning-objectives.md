# Box Model and Positioning Learning Objectives

Below is a complete list of the terminal learning objectives for this lesson.
When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the
following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the
assessment for this lesson.

1. Describe how:
   * padding and margins work in the box model
   * the browser positions a fixed positioned element
   * the browser positions a relatively positioned element
   * the browser positions absolutely positioned elements with and without a
     relatively positioned parent element
   * the browser positions a static positioned element
2. Identify elements rendered with specific padding and margin settings
3. Apply padding and margins to HTML elements to achieve a desired layout
4. Apply positioning settings to elements (fixed, relative, and absolute) to
   HTML elements to achieve a desired layout
5. Identify which HTML elements have a default "inline" display value
6. Identify which HTML elements have a default "block" display value
7. Describe and use z-index positioning of elements

*Note:* You will learn about _sticky_ positioning. Because it's not supported on
old but still used browsers, you will not be assessed on it. However, feel free
to learn about it and use it in your code unless otherwise specifically
instructed to do otherwise.
