*   Flexible Box Model

Flexbox is a CSS module that provides a convenient way for us to display items inside a _flexible_ container so that the layout is responsive.

With flexbox, a containerâ€™s width and height automatically adjust to fit the viewport, and the sizing, alignment, and spacing of the items inside the container are optimized for the available space.

Pre-flexbox float
-----------------

Back in ye olden pre-flexbox days, developers used a few different CSS techniques to display/position elements in a container, the most common of which is [float](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/).

Born from the print layout notion of text wrapping around images, the float property has been widely used to create Web page layouts. The basic idea behind floated elements is that, like images in a print layout, they are considered part of the _flow_ of the page. Other elements, like text that wraps, will _reflow_ around the floated elements.

A tricky and inconvenient issue related to float is the necessity of _clearing_ the float. This is what happens when floated elements have not been cleared:

Because other non-floated elements take up the available space around a floated element, we need to `clear` the float by setting up an empty DIV (i.e. block element) after it, or by setting up a `.clearfix:after` pseudo selector in CSS. (Read more about this in this CSS-Tricks doc about [float](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)).

By resizing elements in the container, or parent element, and redistributing space evenly around elements, flexbox takes care of such issues for us.

Using flexbox
-------------

With flexbox, a container element is automatically resized to fit the viewport size without needing to use breakpoints. Elements within the container are resized and distributed to best fill the available space. See the image below for an example of how elements in a container would be laid out using flexbox:

The [flexbox layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) consists of CSS styles applied to:

*   A parent element (i.e. _**flex container**_)
*   Its children (i.e. _**flex items**_)

### Flex container styles

To set a parent element to be a flex container, we simply need to apply `display: flex` to a CSS class selector, like so:

    .container {
      display: flex;  /* OR inline-flex */
    }

By default, flex items will try to fit onto one line. To get elements within the container to wrap to a new line, we need to add the `flex-wrap` property to the container:

    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;  /* OR nowrap OR wrap-reverse. */
    }

We can also set the direction of the main axis using `flex-direction`. This allows us to create either _rows_ or _columns_ of elements:

    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      flex-direction: row;  /* OR row-reverse OR column OR column-reverse */
    }

![Flex direction](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Responsive-Design/flexbox/assets/flex-direction.png)

We can combine both `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` with a single property called `flex-flow`:

    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-flow: row wrap;  /* Use the flex-direction first, followed by the flex-wrap. */
    }

Additional properties we can set on the flexbox container include:

*   `justify-content` -- Defines the alignment of flex items along the main axis and distributes extra container space around/between items.
*   `align-items` -- Like justify-content for the cross axis (e.g. items aligned on the Y axis, instead of the X axis).
*   `align-content` -- Redistributes extra space on the cross axis.

### Flex items styles

We are not required to put styles on the flex items, but we may choose to do so for additional customization.

By default, flex items appear in the order they are added to the DOM (i.e. the order they are listed in an HTML file). However, we can use the `order` property to change their order in the flex container.

    .item-1 {
      order: 1;  /* Must be an integer. Default is 0. */
    }
    .item-2 {
      order: 2;  /* Must be an integer. Default is 0. */
    }
    .item-3 {
      order: 3;  /* Must be an integer. Default is 0. */
    }

Additional properties we can set on flex items include:

*   `flex-grow` -- Dictates amount of available space inside the flex container the item should take up. Must be an integer. Default is 0.
*   `flex-shrink` -- Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. Must be an integer. Default is 1.
*   `flex-basis` -- The default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword (e.g. auto, content).
*   `flex` -- Shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`. Default is 0 1 auto.
*   `align-self` -- Overrides default alignment set by the `align-items` property on the container.
