<h1 id="node-postgres-docs-repo">node-postgres docs repo</h1>
<p>This repo holds the documentation running at <a href="https://node-postgres.com">https://node-postgres.com</a>.</p>
<p>It’s built on a gatsby template I found and modified. I’d like to go through and convert the gatsby scaffolding code to typescript at some point. If anything in the documentation is unclear please feel free to open an issue or just change it &amp; submit a pull request!</p>
