# CodeStream

CodeStream is a developer collaboration platform that integrates essential dev tools, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Slack, Teams, Jira, Trello and more, into VS Code. Eliminate context-switching and simplify code discussion and code review by putting collaboration tools in your IDE.

### Requirements

- CodeStream requires a current version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and is also available for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream), [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs) or [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/codestream).
- Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub.

### Guided Installation Option

Help us improve CodeStream for first-time users by participating in a 20-minute zoom call: screen-share while we guide you along the way and demonstrate CodeStream's capabilities. If you work on a team with at least 10 developers [please schedule a time here](https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/claudio13/a-codestream-specialist-supports-your-onboarding-live).

# Create and Review GitHub Pull Requests in VS Code

Create, review and merge pull requests inside VS Code, with full source-tree and full file access, your favorite keybindings, built-in diff too, and code intelligence.

# Get Feedback on Work-in-Progress with Pre-PR Code Reviews

CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you get feedback on your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.

CodeStream’s feedback requests encourage developers to share progress throughout the development process rather than waiting until the end or a feature branch. Get feedback on your work-in-progress to align design with implementation and streamline final code review.

# Simplified Code Discussion

Rather than copying & pasting, CodeStream enables in-editor commenting on any code in your repository, with optional sharing to Slack, Teams or via email, with automatic at-mentioning of code authors via git blame.

Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, or from Slack, Teams, or replying to the email.

# Build the Knowledge Base Behind Your Codebase

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Comment and code review threads are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.

Previously discussed questions and issues that explain important decisions are now accessible right where you need them, when you need them. Just click on the codemark to expand it and see how something works or why something was done a certain way.

# Team Transparency through Live View

Development is a collaborative activity, yet much of it happens in isolation, with work only shared with the team at the end of a cycle, or sprint. CodeStream’s “LiveView” increases transparency by making the local edits of individual developers visible to team members, so that everyone knows what everyone else is working on, in real-time.

As developers write code, whether editing existing files or creating new files, a summary of their changes, including the repo(s), files, and lines changed is exposed to their teammates through CodeStream. The information is displayed contextually, in the IDE, and even warns teammates of potential merge conflicts… before they happen!

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where are messages stored?

Your team’s codemarks, which include the message text and the code snippet, are stored in the cloud on CodeStream’s servers. CodeStream uses best practices when it comes to [security](https://www.codestream.com/security), but if your team has stringent infosec requirements an [on-prem installation option](https://docs.codestream.com/onprem/) is available.
