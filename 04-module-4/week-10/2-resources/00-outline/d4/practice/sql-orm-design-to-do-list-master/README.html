<p>That’s right, it’s the return of the command-line to-do list manager. But, this time, you’re going to use a database!</p>
<p>This is your first database design project. There are three kinds of things in this application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categories</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>To-Do Items</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure out the necessary attributes from the application. Then, modify each screen file to include the models and use them.</p>
<p>This is a runnable application, it just doesn’t do anything. In each of the <strong>-screen.js</strong> files, you will find comments marked <code>// TODO:</code> with hints about what you should do there.</p>
<p>To run the application, type <code>node program.js</code>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to start out with using the Sequelize CLI to initialize your application. Then, generate models and migrations and seeders, if you’d like. Use them to make the application work.</p>
<p>Download the starter project from https://github.com/appacademy-starters/sql-orm-design-to-do-list.</p>
<h2 id="importing-your-models-to-use">Importing your models to use</h2>
<p>To import your models, say you had two named <code>Task</code> and <code>Category</code>, write a statement like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> <span class="op">{</span> Task<span class="op">,</span> Category <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&#39;./models&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="screen-reminder">Screen reminder</h2>
<p>Here is a walk-through of how the application works.</p>
<h3 id="main-menu">Main menu</h3>
<p>This is the screen that appears when you first run the program. When someone types a “1” and hits enter, it will take them to the <strong>to-do items list</strong>. When someone types “2” and hits enter, it takes them to the <strong>search screen</strong>. When someone types “3” and hits enter, it takes them to the <strong>category management</strong> screen. When someone types “X” and hits enter, it cleanly exits your program. If the user types something that doesn’t match the options, have it reprint this same screen.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* TO-DO FOR YOU!!!!!            (c) 1987   *
********************************************

Please choose one of the following options:
1. Review my to-do items
2. Search for a to-do item
3. Manage categories

X. Exit

Type a number to go to another screen. Type
an X to return to the main menu.

&gt; _</code></pre>
<h3 id="category-management">Category management</h3>
<p>Support the ability to categorize your to-do items. When someone chooses “3” from the main screen, they should get this page. Support up to five categories and no more.If the user types something that doesn’t match the options, have it reprint this same screen.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* CATEGORIES                    (c) 1987   *
********************************************

1. Category 1
2. Category 2
3. Category 3
4. Category 4
5. Category 5

X. Go to main screen

Type a number to edit a category. Type an X
to return to the main menu.

&gt; _</code></pre>
<h3 id="editing-a-category">Editing a category</h3>
<p>When someone selects a category on the last screen, it will bring them to this screen that will allow someone to rename a category. Limit the category name to 30 characters. If someone types more than 30 characters, it’s up to you to determine how to handle that. After someone successfully submits a new category name, have it return the <strong>Category management</strong> screen.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* EDIT CATEGORY                 (c) 1987   *
********************************************

You are editing &quot;Category 2&quot;.

What would you like to rename it? Hit
&quot;Enter&quot; when you are done.

&gt; _
</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-do-item-search-screen">To-do item search screen</h3>
<p>When someone is here, they can type a search term to search the to-do items’ text values. If a to-do item has more than one text field, then search by any of them. Category names should not be text fields. When someone types a value and hits enter, it goes to the <strong>search results screen</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* SEARCH ITEMS                  (c) 1987   *
********************************************

Please type your search term and hit Enter.

&gt; _
</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-do-item-search-results">To-do item search results</h3>
<p>Here you can see the to-do items that matched your search result. Determine how many rows are in the console (you can use <code>process.stdout.rows</code> to get the number), subtract eight for the non-item text, and print up to that many tasks. When the person hits the “Enter” key, it will return to the <strong>main screen</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* SEARCH RESULTS                (c) 1987   *
********************************************

Your search matches:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Press Enter to return to the main screen. _</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-do-items-list">To-do items list</h3>
<p>Here you can see a number of to-do items that will fit in the console (you can use <code>process.stdout.rows</code> to get the number). If a person types “X” and hits “Enter”, it will take them to the <strong>main screen</strong>. If a person types a number of a task and hits “Enter”, it will take them to the <strong>to-do item detail screen</strong>. If as person types an “A”, it will take them to the <strong>to-do item create screen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This screen should only show tasks that are not completed!</strong></p>
<p>If it’s a <em>Note</em>, show only the first 70 characters of the value. If it’s a <em>Task</em>, show the first 70 characters of the title.</p>
<pre><code>********************************************
* TO-DO ITEMS                   (c) 1987   *

<h3 id="to-do-item-detail-screen">To-do item detail screen</h3>
