@here Another framework: 

Understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs?
Come up with a plan - write out pseudocode (step as comments in english)
Execute the plan - transform the english steps into lines of code
Reflect, refactor - look over your code to troubleshoot, find errors using 
console.log and fix, rewrite repeated or confusing code so it is clear and
DRY (don't repeat yourself)
