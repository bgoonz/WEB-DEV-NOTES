# JavaScript REPL

JavaScript REPL is a javascript playground for Visual Studio Code with live feedback(logs or errors) as you type, besides your code, in a log explorer, or in an output channel. It supports Javascript, TypeScript, CoffeeScript and it can be used for development in Node.js projects or with front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte etc.

### Logging

Users can add logs in their code with the following ways:

```js
// You can add logs by using console.log
console.log('We â™¡ JavaScript!');

// or by using a comment line with equals sign at the end of an expression
const obj = {
  language: 'javascript'
}; //=

function hello() {
  return 'Hello World!';
}
// or a comment block with equals sign
hello(); /*= */

// or just type the variable name
obj;

// if the log represents an object you can use the dollar sign to access its properties
obj; //= $.language

//  also inside the log comments you can print every expression in your scope
hello(); //= obj

// Besides, you can select one or more variables or expressions and press right-click
//and select show value or explore the logs at the explorer on the left
```

## Issues

Javascript REPL extension does not send any analytics data about the users or the kind of use that they are doing. So It will be very helpful, if you report an issue about a problem that you had during your repl sessions, and is really appreciated, if you provide any feedback about the extension user experience â™¡. More information [about issues](https://github.com/axilleasiv/vscode-javascript-repl-docs/wiki/Issues) or the [part of the source code](https://github.com/axilleasiv/vscode-javascript-repl-docs/wiki/Source-Code) that have not been open-sourced yet users can find on wiki pages.

This extension uses under the hood a modified version of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler. So I would like to say a big thank you to the guys there. You can find the modified version at the following [branch](https://github.com/axilleasiv/parcel/tree/vs-repl).

## Inspiration

I'd like to give a shout out to [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com), which is a significantly more comprehensive and covers a lot more editors, if this extension interests you - check out that too. Also, when I started to play around this, I started with the code of the following [extension](https://github.com/lostfields/vscode-nodejs-repl)
