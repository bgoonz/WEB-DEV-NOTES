# VBScript Language Support

This package provides syntax highlighting only. It is nothing more than an import of a .tmLanguage file. Feel free to contribute more.

.tmLanguage file taken from: https://github.com/SublimeText/VBScript and/or https://github.com/textmate/asp.vb.net.tmbundle which had no license that I saw. If this is yours and you disapprove of this use, just tell me.
