After that, the symbols \"O\" and \"X\"\n  alternate with each click per the rules of tic-tac-toe.\n\nDuring development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.\n\nTo make this game work, you'll eventually get around to checking if one of the\nplayers won or if there is a tie. Plan ahead for how you track the grid clicks\nbecause you'll need to know the \"value\" of each square to calculate wins.\n"
