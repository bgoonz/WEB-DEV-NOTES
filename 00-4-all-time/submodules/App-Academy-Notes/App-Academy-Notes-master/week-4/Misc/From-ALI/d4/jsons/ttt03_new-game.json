To do this,\nyou will need to perform the following:\n\n* When the game status is not \"won\" or \"tied\", then the \"New Game\" button is\n  disabled.\n* When the game status is \"won\" or \"tied\", then the \"New Game\" button is\n  enabled.\n* When a player clicks the \"New Game\" button, then it\n  * clears the game status,\n  * clears the header,\n  * clears the board, and\n  * makes it so the next click of the tic-tac-toe board is an \"X\"\n  * (disables the \"New Game\" button)\n\nDuring development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.\n"
