# SQL Learning Objectives

SQL is the language of relational data. It is one of the core languages that
most software developers know because of its prevalence in the industry due to
the common use of RDBMSes. The objectives for your SQL learning journey cover:

* How to use the `SELECT ... FROM ...` statement to select data from a single
  table
* How to use the `WHERE` clause on `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements
  to narrow the scope of the command
* How to use the `JOIN` keyword to join two (or more) tables together into a
  single virtual table
* How to use the `INSERT` statement to insert data into a table
* How to use an `UPDATE` statement to update data in a table
* How to use a `DELETE` statement to remove data from a table
* How to use a seed file to populate data in a database
* How to perform relational database design
* How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or
  fail operation
* How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance
* Explain what and why someone would use `EXPLAIN`
* Demonstrate how to install and use the **node-postgres** library and its
  `Pool` class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database
* Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for parameters
  of the form "$1", "$2", and so on
