Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s proprietary globally-distributed, multi-model database service for managing data on a global scale. It offers a variety of APIs for your database including Azure Table, Core (SQL), MongoDB and Gremlin (GraphQL). Web Template Studio offers you the functionality to deploy a Cosmos DB instance from the wizard itself and select an initial location to deploy your database with the ability to scale it to multiple locations at a future time. As an added feature, deploying with the MongoDB API enables you to quickly connect the project Web Template Studio generates to your database instance.
