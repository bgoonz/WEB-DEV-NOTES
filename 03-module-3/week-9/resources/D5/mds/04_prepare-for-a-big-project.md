# Putting It Together

________________________________________________________________________________
Tomorrow, you're going to put together what you've been studying in a less
structured way, where you will be called upon to apply your knowledge in total.
You're not going to learn anything new except, perhaps, some best practices and
pro-tips. Instead, you'll be _synthesizing_ what you've learned up to this
point. Review your work. Do your flash cards. Get some rest. Tomorrow, you have
to get with the cogitation.
