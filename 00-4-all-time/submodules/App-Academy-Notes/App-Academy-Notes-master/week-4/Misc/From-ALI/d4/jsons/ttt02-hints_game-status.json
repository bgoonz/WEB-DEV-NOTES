    "body": "# Hints 3: Determining Game Status\n\nTo do this, you can write a function that checks the values of each of the\nsquares that have been played in. If any three in a row have the same value,\nthen the player associated with that symbol is the winner. If there is no winner\nand all of the spaces have a symbol, then it is a tie. That's the general idea.\n\nPlease go back and read the Hints for Requirement 2 to understand the following\nvariables that have been declared in the game.\n\n* `currentPlayerSymbol`: the symbol of the player that has the next click\n* `squareValues`: an array that contains the symbols for each of the squares\n\nWith those variables declared (or ones like them), add code that will perform\nthe following functionality.\n\nIn the JavaScript file:\n\n* Create a top-level variable named `gameStatus` and set it to the empty string.\n* Create a top-level function named `checkGameStatus` that will loop through all\n  of the rows and columns, and check the diagonals to determine if there is a\n  winner. In it, perform these checks\n  * If there is a winner, set the `gameStatus` value to the uppercase value of\n    the value that is winning symbol.\n  * If there is no winner, then check if all of the squares are full. If they\n    are, then set the `gameStatus` equal to \"None\".\n  * If the `gameStatus` is not an empty string, set\n    `document.getElementById('game-status').innerHTML` to the concatenated value\n    of \"Winner: \" and the value of `gameStatus`. Use the `id` value of\n    `game-status` to get a reference to that element.\n* Add a check at the beginning of the click handler for the grid that prevents\n  the rest of the event handler from running if the `gameStatus` value is not an\n  empty string. (This is as simple as adding an `if` statement that tests for it\n  and has a `return` statement inside the curly braces.)\n  ```js\n  if (gameStatus !== '') return; // This just stops\n                                 // the rest of the function\n                                 // from running.\n  ```\n* At the end of the of the click handler for the grid to call the\n  `checkGameStatus` function.\n\n![game status tracking](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/requirement-3.gif)\n\n## How to find a winning game\n\nConsider using a one-dimensional array with nine entries to store your\nrepresentation of the board. Then, you can map each of the nine entries to a\nsquare on the board kind of like what you see in the following picture where\nthe 0-index entry in the array is the top-left square of the board, the 1-index\nentry in the array is the top-middle square, the 2-index entry is the top-righ,\nthe 3-index entry is the middle-left, and so on.\n\n![mapping an array to a board](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/array-to-board.png)\n\nIf that's the model that you have, then you can check the rows of the board for\na win by comparing the first three entries of the array with one another, the\nsecond three entries with one another, and the third three entries with one\nanother. Here's the breakdown of the rows of the tic-tac-toe-board mapped to the\nentries in the array.\n\n![mapping rows in the array](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/rows-in-the-array.png)\n\nAssume the name of your array that holds the board values is named `board`. You\ncan determine if the first row has a winning combination of entries by doing\nthe following comparison:\n\n```js\nif (board[0] === board[1] && board[1] === board[2] && board[2] !== '') {\n  // do something because a player won on the first row!\n}\n```\n\nYou can just do the same for the other two rows, too.\n\nTo find the columns in the array, you can refer to the following image.\n\n![mapping columns in the array](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/columns-in-the-array.png)\n\nFinally, to find the diagonals, you need to map squares 0, 4, and 9 for the\ntop-left to bottom right and the 2, 4, 6 squares for the top-right to the\nbottom-left like in the following picture.\n\n![mapping diagonals in the array](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/diagonals-in-the-array.png)\n"
