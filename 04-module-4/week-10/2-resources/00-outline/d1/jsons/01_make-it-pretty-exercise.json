What would you think if you reviewed a site that looked unfinished, or\npoorly styled, even if the functionality worked perfectly? Would you have the\nperspective to tell the difference from a poorly implemented site and one that\nis robust, but not visually polished?\n\nNon-technical people will be looking at your projects before engineers, and they\ncan't see the amount of work it takes to get a backend up and running. All they\nsee is the visual appearance, so unless you take care of your frontend you'll\nnever even get the chance to talk about the backend work you did.\n\nThis material should make it so that you can\n\n* Evaluate your site against industry-standard visual styles\n* Identify the attributes of current trends in website presentation\n* Identify gaps that can cause a website to be perceived as incomplete\n\n## What Recruiters Are Looking For\n\nRecruiters expect professionalism and good design (we'll discuss more about what\ngood design means below). A good litmus test is: if you were to stumble upon\nyour portfolio sight unexpectedly, would you be able to tell that this wasn't\ndone by a professional dev? In other words, does your website look on par with\nthe millions of other production sites that exist on the internet?\n\nIn response to what recruiters and interviewers might ask about how you choose\ndifferent styles for your Web applications, review TopTal's [12 Essential Web\nInterview Questions].\n\n## Attributes of Great Looking Websites\n\nUnless you know exactly what you are doing when deciding on a visual approach,\nyou should select and follow a modern design framework, or use a template.\n\nThe first thing to pay attention to is padding and margin. Every element should\nhave padding so that its inner contents are not butting up against its edges and\nmargin so that the element itself is not butting up against any other elements.\nIn general sibling elements should NOT touch or overlap.  A good way to estimate\nthe correct amount is to imagine a lower-case `a` in the same size and font of\nnearby text.  You should be able to fit this `a` in both the padding and the\nmargin such that it just barely touches the edge/text on each side.\n\nBe sure to balance whitespace when laying out your elements and adding\nmargin/padding. If you have 20px of whitespace to the left of the element you\nshould probably have 20px to the right as well. Make sure things are centered\ncorrectly (horizontally and vertically) and be consistent! I.E. If you have a\nrow of buttons in the header they should all be aligned vertically with\nconsistent margin and padding.\n\nUse a [color palette] to determine your website's themes and avoid color\nclashes. You should have a primary color, a secondary color, and 1 or 2 accent\ncolors. Your primary color is going to be the most abundant on the site followed\nby your secondary color. The accent color is used for things like buttons,\ntools, and other areas that you want to draw the user's eye to.  Use it\nsparingly!\n\nUse [Google Font Pairing] recommendations to find good fonts. In general, you\nshould not have more than 2 fonts in a web app and you should avoid mixing serif\nand sans-serif fonts.\n\nPay attention to font-size and weight! You should use [textual hierarchies] to\nbreak up your text and make it easier to read. Prefer multiple short lines to\nfewer long lines of text when displaying info to the user. Your headers should\nbe large and paragraphs should be slightly smaller font size. Having widely\nvarying and inconsistent font sizes is one of the surest signs that a website\nwas designed by a beginner.  When in doubt, simplify.\n\nMake sure your color and text choices pass [contrast requirements].\n\nMost modern websites slightly round the corners of buttons and background\ncards/modals. [You should, too]. Also, take advantage of advanced CSS features\nlike transitions and shadows to make your site pop. Make sure you let your user\nknow what parts of the site are alive through affordances.\n\n## Additional requirements\n\nIn addition to the above recommendations, App Academy also expects your projects\nto include the following:\n\n* **Seed Data**: Make sure your seeds are plentiful and appropriate. Even an\n  excellently designed site will fail to impress if you don't have a good seed\n  data.\n* **Favicon**: Make sure your website has a [favicon].\n* **Demo Login**: Make sure your website has a demo login. Most recruiters will\n  not sign up for your website with their own email address as the chance for\n  misuse of said email address is too high.\n* **Console output**: Be sure that your console is free of logs and error\n  messages. Nothing screams amateur more than seeing a ton of console.logs when\n  visiting a potential candidate's website.\n* **Personal Links**: Any links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, or Angel List should\n  open in a new tab.\n* **Scorecard**: After you graduate, you'll stop using Progress Tracker and\n  start using InterviewDB, another one of our applications. When you go to turn\n  in your project on InterviewDB, be sure to include the scorecard so that your\n  advisor can grade your work. Note that you'll need to make your own copy and\n  save it to your google drive before adding the link to InterviewDB.\n\n## Avoid these things\n\nWe have collected a lot of feedback from recruiters and hiring managers over the\nyears. These are the tips and tricks that they tell us will turn them off to\nreviewing a student's project.\n\n* Avoid fonts that look like handwriting\n* Avoid over using accent colors\n* Avoid themes that relate to specific holidays (ie. don't make a Christmas\n  themed app)\n* Dead Links. If you didn't implement a feature then don't put a link to it. If\n  you do, then you're forcing recruiters to find the needle of implemented\n  features in a haystack of unimplemented features.  Your site will be perceived\n  as incomplete or broken\n* Avoid linking to the actual site that you are cloning\n* Avoid neon, bright, or crazy colors\n* Avoid having too many different colors in your app.\n* Avoid putting affordances on things that can't be clicked or interacted with\n* Avoid blinking, spinning or flashing images\n* Avoid busy tiled background images with any color text\n* Avoid having everything centered.  When in doubt, do not center.  Do not\n  center more than three lines of text\n* Avoid too many images or huge images.  Minify all images that are not of a\n  product and do not need to be examined closely\n* Avoid long lists of links\n* Avoid too many headlines\n* Do not use blinking or flashing text, images, or transitions\n\n\n## Exercise\nSelect three sites from [Product Hunt].  For each site, list the:\n\n* Fonts Used\n* Colors in Palette\n* Contrast ratio of the main text and it's background ([Use the contrast\n  checker])\n* The size of padding/margins compared to a lowercase 'a'\n* The maximum number of lines in a row center-justified anywhere on the site\n* Load Time\n* Theme or style based on (Bootstrap, Material, etc.)\n* Number of broken or under construction pages\n\n\n[color palette]: https://99designs.com/blog/tips/the-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory/\n[Google Font Pairing]: https://fonts.google.com/\n[textual hierarchies]: https://blog.designcrowd.com/article/867/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-text\n[You should, too]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius\n[affordances]: https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-glossary-how-to-use-affordances-in-user-interfaces-393c8e9686e4\n[favicon]: https://www.abeautifulsite.net/what-are-favicons\n[12 Essential Web Interview Questions]: https://www.toptal.com/designers/web/interview-questions\n[Product Hunt]: https://www.producthunt.com/\n[contrast requirements]: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\n[Use the contrast checker]: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\n"
