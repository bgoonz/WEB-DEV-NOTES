    "body": "# Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses)\n\nWelcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! In this multi-step project, you will create\na well-designed HTML+CSS+JS browser-based application that will allow you to\nplay tic-tac-toe. It will combine all of the concepts that\nyou learned in browser basics, element selection and handling, storage, and\nJSON.\n\nEach step has three parts:\n\n* The requirements for the next step of the application\n* A reading that will help you design it\n* A video walk-through of a \"good\" solution, where \"good\" means clear, concise,\n  and maintainable\n\nThe reason they're set up this way is so that you can attempt to do the\nrequirements yourself. If you get stuck on how to do it, then there is a reading\navailable for you to help you take the next step in code. You can watch the\nvideo if you get really stuck or to compare your solution to the way that we\nimplemented it.\n\n> Remember: working software with **nicely-formatted source code** is the _best_\n> software.\n\nPlease fork and clone the repository found at\nhttps://github.com/appacademy-starters/dom-api-tic-tac-toe. In that repository,\nyou will find the following files:\n\n* **index.html**: The HTML file to which you'll make small modifications that\n  will make the UI work\n* **site.css**: The CSS file that contains all of the styles for your UI\n* **tic-tac-toe.js**: The JavaScript file you'll modify to add behavior to your\n  game\n\nHere's what it will look like when you're done.\n\n![what the game should look like](https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/requirement-6.gif)\n\n## The rules of tic-tac-toe\n\nIn case you don't know the rules of tic-tac-toe, here are some links for you to\ninvestigate.\n\n* Solitaire Classic's [How to play Tic Tac Toe] video\n* [Wikipedia's tic-tac-toe article]\n\n[How to play Tic Tac Toe]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SdW0_wTX5c\n[Wikipedia's tic-tac-toe article]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\n\n## Interesting sections of the index.html\n\nYou'll find three sections of interest in the **index.html**.\n\nNear the top of the body of content, you'll see an `h1` with an id\n`game-status`. You'll use that element to indicate which player won the game (or\nif there is a tie).\n\nIn the middle of the body of content, you'll see the following HTML that\nrepresents the tic-tac-toe board. The outer `<div>` makes the black background\nthat you see as the vertical and horizontal lines of the board. The nine\nchildren `<div>` elements are the nine squares of the board. Those are the HTML\nelements that players will click on to place their symbol there.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"tic-tac-toe-board\">\n  <div id=\"square-0\" class=\"square row-1 col-1\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-1\" class=\"square row-1 col-2\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-2\" class=\"square row-1 col-3\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-3\" class=\"square row-2 col-1\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-4\" class=\"square row-2 col-2\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-5\" class=\"square row-2 col-3\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-6\" class=\"square row-3 col-1\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-7\" class=\"square row-3 col-2\"></div>\n  <div id=\"square-8\" class=\"square row-3 col-3\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAt the bottom of the body of content are the action buttons. You'll subscribe\nto each of their `click` events to make the game work\n\n```html\n<div class=\"actions\">\n  <button>New Game</button>\n  <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n  <button>Give Up</button>\n</div>\n```\n"
