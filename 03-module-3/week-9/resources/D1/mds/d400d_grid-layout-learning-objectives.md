# Grid Layout Learning Objectives

Below is a complete list of the terminal learning objectives for this lesson.
When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the
following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the
assessment for this lesson.

1. Explain how grid layout lays out elements
2. Use the `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-template`
   properties to specify the layout of the grid using relative and absolute
   measures
3. Use `grid-template-areas` to label areas of a grid and `grid-area` to assign
   an element to the area
4. Use `grid-column-gap`, `grid-row-gap`, and `grid-gap` to set the "gutter"
   areas between elements in a grid layout
5. Use `grid-column-start`/`grid-column-end` and `grid-row-start`/`grid-row-end`
   to create spans across multiple columns and rows with positive integers,
   negative integers, and in conjunction with the "span" operator
6. Explain and use the shorthand versions of `grid-column` and `grid-row` to
   define how an element will span a grid layout
7. Use the `order` property to change the default order in which items are laid
   out
8. Explain and use the "fr" unit of measure
9. Use `justify-items`, `align-items`, `justify-content` and `align-content` to
   layout items in each grid area
