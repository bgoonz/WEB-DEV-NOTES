# Callback Exercises

It's time to get some practice using callbacks! Below we've included a link to
download a `zip` file for a number of problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified. You should have `mocha` installed
and will need to pass all the tests in order to move on.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you
downloaded.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `mocha` to run the test cases

The `mocha` command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this
don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!

P.S. You may notice the `package.json`/`package-lock.json` files and
`node_modules` directory. You do not need to edit any of those contents. Those
files are what we use the package the project and create the test cases.
