5 Great Visual Studio Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are five of my favorite keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio.

Move Code Alt+Up/Down
 If you put the cursor on a line of code and use the Alt+Up Arrow keys,
the line of code you've selected moves up.
If you use the Alt+Down Arrow keys, the line of code selected moves down.

Create Collapsible Region Ctrl+M+H/Ctrl+M+U
Chances are you've noticed the "+" and "-" symbols in the margins that let you collapse and expand your classes and functions.
 Did you know you can create your own collapsible regions?
If you select a section of code and then use the key sequence Ctrl+M+H, you turn that region into a collapsible/expandable region.
 The key sequence Ctrl+M+U will remove the collapsible region. It doesn't delete the code, it just removes the icon that lets you expand and collapse.

Comment Code Block Ctrl+K+C/Ctrl+K+U
Whether it's because you're trying to track down a "but," or experimenting with code change,
from time to time you'll want to comment and uncomment blocks of code.
If you select a block of code and use the key sequence Ctrl+K+C,
you'll comment out the section of code. Ctrl+K+U will uncomment the code.

Peek Definition Alt+F12
When you're going through your code and you want to examine the code in the method you're calling,
many programmers will use the F12 key or the pop-up menu option Go To Definition.
Go To Definition will navigate to the called method;
however, many times you don't need to navigate to the code.
Sometimes, you just want a quick look at the method.
If you've installed Visual Studio 2013, there's a new keyboard shortcut -- Alt+F12 -- that will give you a preview of the method being called inline.
 You can use the Esc key to close the preview.

Navigate Forward/Backward Ctrl+–/Ctrl+Shift+–
When you have multiple files open at the same time, you might want a way to quickly move back and forth between two or three different locations in your code.
 If you've moved from one location to another you can use the keyboard sequence &lt;Ctrl&gt;+– to move to the previous location and then you can return using Ctrl+Shift+–.
