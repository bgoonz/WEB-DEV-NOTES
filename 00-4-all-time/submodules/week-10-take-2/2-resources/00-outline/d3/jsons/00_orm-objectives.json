    "body": "# ORM Objectives\n\nTo ease the use of SQL, the object-relational mapping tool was invented. This\nallows developers to focus on their application code and let a library generate\nall of the SQL for them. Depending on which developer you ask, this is a miracle\nor a travesty. Either way, those developers use them because writing all of the\nSQL by hand is a chore that most software developers just don't want to do.\n\nIn this section, you will learn:\n\n* How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript\n* How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your\n  application in a source-control enabled way\n* How to perform CRUD operations with Sequelize\n* How to query using Sequelize\n* How to perform data validations with Sequelize\n* How to use transactions with Sequelize\n"
