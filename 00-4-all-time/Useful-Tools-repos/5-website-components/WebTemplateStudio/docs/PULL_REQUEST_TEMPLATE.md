## PR checklist

- Quick summary of changes
- Which issue does this PR relate to?
- Anything that requires particular review or attention?
- Do all automated tests pass?
- Have automated tests been added for new features?
- Have you raised issues for any needed follow-on work?
- Have docs been updated?
- If breaking changes or different ways of doing things have been introduced, have they been communicated widely?
