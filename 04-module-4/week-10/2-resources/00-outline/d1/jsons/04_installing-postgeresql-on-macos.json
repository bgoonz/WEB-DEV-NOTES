    "body": "# Installing PostgreSQL 12 and Postbird on macOS\n\nYou will install two pieces of software so that you can start using PostgreSQL.\nYou sill install PostgreSQL itself along with all of its tools. Then you will\nalso install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface that makes\nworking with SQL and PostgreSQL better than just using the command line tool\n`psql`.\n\nYou can install both of these products using Homebrew. Your Windows-using\nclassmates don't have this convenience, so pretend you're having a hard time\ndoing this. ðŸ˜‰\n\n## Installing PostgreSQL 12\n\nFirst, update your Homebrew installation. You should do this before each thing\nthat you install using Homebrew.\n\n```shell\nbrew update\n```\n\nNow, make sure that you have the correct Homebrew recipe. Type the following\nand make sure that the first line of the output contains some version of \"12\".\n\n```shell\nbrew info postgresql\n```\n\nYou should see something like this in the output.\n\n```\npostgresql: stable 12.2 (bottled), HEAD\n```\n\nNow, launch the installation.\n\n```\nbrew install postgresql\n```\n\nThis may take a while. Have a tea.\n\n## Configuring PostgreSQL 12\n\nWhen that completes, you can read the **Caveats** section from the installation\noutput. You should do this with _everything_ that you install using Homebrew.\n\n```shell\nTo migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:\n  brew postgresql-upgrade-database\n\nTo have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:\n  brew services start postgresql\nOr, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:\n  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start\n```\n\nYou definitely want PostgreSQL to run now and every time you log in. Otherwise\nyou'd have to start it every time you reboot your computer which can be a\nhassle. Following the instructions, please type the following into the command\nline.\n\n```shell\nbrew services start postgresql\n```\n\nThat should report that PostgreSQL is now started.\n\n## Connecting to PostgreSQL\n\nTo make sure your client tools are configured properly, type the following in\na Terminal. This tells the `psql` client that you want to connect to the\n\"postgres\" database, which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is\ninstalled.\n\n```shell\npsql postgres\n```\n\nThat will connect to the \"postgres\" database as your user that you're logged in\nas, which the installer configured for you during the installation. It's the\nsame as specifying your user name by using the \"-U\" command line parameter and\ntyping.\n\n```\npsql -U Â«your user nameÂ» postgres\n```\n\nWhen you successfully log in, it should show you the following output.\n\n```\npsql (12.2)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=#\n```\n\nType `\\q` and hit Return to quit the PostgreSQL client.\n\n## Installing Postbird\n\nMake sure that your Homebrew can find Postbird. Search for it using the `brew\nsearch` command.\n\n```shell\nbrew search postbird\n```\n\nYou should get something back that looks like this.\n\n```\n==> Casks\npostbird\n```\n\nThat means it could find it. Since it's a **Cask**, that means it's an\napplication that is meant to be used as a graphical user interface rather than\non the command line. To install it, you need to include \"cask\" in the command.\n\n```shell\nbrew cask install postbird\n```\n\nOnce it installs, try starting it. It's in your Applications directory. You can\nuse Spotlight to launch it by pressing Command+Space. In the Spotlight window,\ntype \"postbird\". It should show you the recently-installed application's logo in\nthe list as a white circle with a blue elephant. Select that and press Enter (or\nclick it, if you're the touchpad/mouse kind of person).\n\nThe first time it starts, you may get this error.\n\n![Postbird unidentified developer]\n\nYou should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren't\nsigned with an Apple Developer Certificate yet. Click \"Cancel\". We will need\nto tell macOS we would like to run this application despite it not being signed.\n\nOpen up your Applications directory by clicking on the shortcut in the left bar\nof Finder.\n\n![Finder Applications shortcut]\n\nFind the Postbird application in there. Hold down the Option key and left-click\nthe icon. (If you're using the touchpad, this probably means two-finger tap.)\nOnce the context menu shows up, you can let go of the Option key. Then, click\nthe \"Open\" menu item. You will now see a new version of the popup from before\nwith an extra button.\n\n![Postbird open confirmation]\n\nClick the \"Open\" button. That will let Postbird run. Now that you've done that\nonce, you won't have to do it again for Postbird. This is valuable knowledge\nabout how to run open-source software on macOS that isn't signed by the\ndevelopers. However, it is a good security practice to only run applications\nfrom developers that you trust. The Postbird application is used by tens of\nthousands of software developers and is something that you can trust.\n\nIn fact, the developer of Postbird has an ['issue' on github] about this very\nthing. So hopefully they will get the signing of the app fixed in a future\nversion.\n\nWhen Postbird starts, type \"postgres\" into the database field. Then, click the\n\"Connect\" button. It should open a new tab and show you basically a blank page.\nThat means everything worked! Exit Postbird by pressing Command+Q or selecting\nPostbird > \"Quit Postbird\" from the menu.\n\n## What you did\n\nYou installed and configured PosgreSQL 12, a relational database management\nsystem, and tools to use it! Well done!\n\n[Postbird unidentified developer]: https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-unidentified-developer.png\n[Finder Applications shortcut]: https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/finder-applications-shortcut.png\n[Postbird open confirmation]: https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-open-confirmation.png\n['issue' on github]: https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/issues/16\n"
