<p>At Sequelize, we prioritize security issues and will try to fix them as soon as they are disclosed.</p>
<p>If you discover a security vulnerability, please reach out to the project maintainers privately. You can find related information in <a href="./CONTACT.md">CONTACT.md</a>.</p>
<p>After validating &amp; discussing scope of security vulnerability, we will set a time-frame for patch distribution. This time-frame may vary depending upon the nature of vulnerability.</p>
<p>Once affected versions are patched you may report security issue to any Node.js security vulnerability database. A few which we have worked with in past are listed below.</p>
