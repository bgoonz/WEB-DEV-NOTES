  single virtual table
* How to use the `INSERT` statement to insert data into a table
* How to use an `UPDATE` statement to update data in a table
* How to use a `DELETE` statement to remove data from a table
* How to use a seed file to populate data in a database
* How to perform relational database design
* How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or
  fail operation
* How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance
* Explain what and why someone would use `EXPLAIN`

# Retrieving Rows From A Table Using SELECT

In the first reading, we covered SQL and PostgreSQL and how to set up
PostgreSQL. In this reading, we're going to learn how to write a simple SQL
query using SELECT.

## What is a query?

SQL stands for _Structured Query Language_, and whenever we write
SQL we're usually querying a database. A query is simply a question we're
asking a database, and we're aiming to get a response back. The response comes
back to us as a list of table rows.

## Example table

Let's say we had the following database table called `puppies`. We'll use this
table to make our queries:

_**puppies table**_

| name     | age_yrs | breed               | weight_lbs | microchipped |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Cooper   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 18         | yes          |
| Indie    | 0.5     | Yorkshire Terrier   | 13         | yes          |
| Kota     | 0.7     | Australian Shepherd | 26         | no           |
| Zoe      | 0.8     | Korean Jindo        | 32         | yes          |
| Charley  | 1.5     | Basset Hound        | 25         | no           |
| Ladybird | 0.6     | Labradoodle         | 20         | yes          |
| Callie   | 0.9     | Corgi               | 16         | no           |
| Jaxson   | 0.4     | Beagle              | 19         | yes          |
| Leinni   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 25         | yes          |
| Max      | 1.6     | German Shepherd     | 65         | no           |

## Using psql in the terminal

As we covered in the first reading, psql allows us to access the PostgreSQL
server and make queries via the terminal. Open up the terminal on your machine,
and connect to the PostgreSQL server by using the following psql command:

```shell
psql -U postgres
```

The above command lets you access the PostgreSQL server as the user 'postgres'
(`-U` stands for user). After you enter this command, you'll be prompted for the
password that you set for the 'postgres' user during installation. Type it in,
and hit Enter. Once you've successfully logged in, you should see the following
in the terminal:

```shell
Password for user postgres:
psql (11.5, server 11.6)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

You can exit psql at anytime with the command `\q`, and you can log back in with
`psql -U postgres`. (_See this [Postgres Cheatsheet][1] for a list of more PSQL commands._)

We'll use the following PostgreSQL to create the `puppies` table above. After
you've logged into the psql server, type the following code and hit Enter.

_**puppies.sql**_
```sql
create table puppies (
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age_yrs NUMERIC(2,1),
  breed VARCHAR(100),
  weight_lbs INT,
  microchipped BOOLEAN
);

insert into puppies
values
('Cooper', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 18, 'yes');

insert into puppies
values
('Indie', 0.5, 'Yorkshire Terrier', 13, 'yes'),
('Kota', 0.7, 'Australian Shepherd', 26, 'no'),
('Zoe', 0.8, 'Korean Jindo', 32, 'yes'),
('Charley', 1.5, 'Basset Hound', 25, 'no'),
('Ladybird', 0.6, 'Labradoodle', 20, 'yes'),
('Callie', 0.9, 'Corgi', 16, 'no'),
('Jaxson', 0.4, 'Beagle', 19, 'yes'),
('Leinni', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 25, 'yes' ),
('Max', 1.6, 'German Shepherd', 65, 'no');
```

In the above SQL, we created a new table called `puppies`, and we gave it the
following columns: `name`, `age_yrs`, `breed`, `weight_lbs`, and `microchipped`.
We filled the table with ten rows containing data for each puppy, by using
`insert into puppies values ()`.

We used the following [PostgreSQL data types][2]: `VARCHAR`, `NUMERIC`, `INT`,
and `BOOLEAN`.

* `VARCHAR(n)` is a variable-length character string that lets you store up to
  _n_ characters. Here we've set the character limit to 100 for the `name` and
  `breed` columns.
* `NUMERIC(p,s)` is a floating-point number with _p_ digits and _s_ number of
  places after the decimal point. Here we've set the values for the `age_yrs`
  column to up to two digits before the decimal and one place after the decimal.
* `INT` is a 4-byte integer, which we've set on the `weight_lbs` column.
* `BOOLEAN` is, of course, a Boolean value. We've set the `microchipped` column
  to accept Boolean values. SQL accepts the standard Boolean values `true`,
  `false`, or `null`. However, you'll note that we've used `yes` and `no` in our
  `microchipped` column because [PostgreSQL Booleans][3] can be any of the
  following values:

| TRUE   | FALSE   |
| ------ | ------- |
| true   | false   |
| 't'    | 'f'     |
| 'true' | 'false' |
| 'yes'  | 'no'    |
| 'y'    | 'n'     |
| '1'    | '0'     |

## Simple SELECT Query

We can write a simple [SELECT query][4] to get results back from the table
above. The syntax for the SELECT query is `SELECT [columns] FROM [table]`.

### SELECT all rows

Using `SELECT *` is a quick way to get back all the rows in a given table. It
is discouraged in queries that you write for your applications. Use it only when
playing around with data, not for production code.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   puppies;
```

Type the query above into your psql terminal, and make sure to add a semicolon
at the end, which terminates the statement. `SELECT` and `FROM` should be
capitalized. The above query should give us back the entire `puppies` table:

| name     | age_yrs | breed               | weight_lbs | microchipped |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Cooper   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 18         | yes          |
| Indie    | 0.5     | Yorkshire Terrier   | 13         | yes          |
| Kota     | 0.7     | Australian Shepherd | 26         | no           |
| Zoe      | 0.8     | Korean Jindo        | 32         | yes          |
| Charley  | 1.5     | Basset Hound        | 25         | no           |
| Ladybird | 0.6     | Labradoodle         | 20         | yes          |
| Callie   | 0.9     | Corgi               | 16         | no           |
| Jaxson   | 0.4     | Beagle              | 19         | yes          |
| Leinni   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 25         | yes          |
| Max      | 1.6     | German Shepherd     | 65         | no           |

### SELECT by column

We can see all the rows in a given column by using `SELECT [column name]`.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM   puppies;
```

Type the query above into your psql terminal, and make sure to add a semicolon
at the end, which terminates the statement. `SELECT` and `FROM` should be
capitalized. The above query should give us back the following:

| name     |
| -------- |
| Cooper   |
| Indie    |
| Kota     |
| Zoe      |
| Charley  |
| Ladybird |
| Callie   |
| Jaxson   |
| Leinni   |
| Max      |

### SELECT multiple columns

To see multiple columns, we can concatenate the column names by using commas
between column names.

```sql
SELECT name
     , age_yrs
     , weight_lbs
FROM   puppies;
```

Type the query above into your psql terminal, and make sure to add a semicolon
at the end, which terminates the statement. `SELECT` and `FROM` should be
capitalized. The above query should give us back the following:

| name     | age_yrs | weight_lbs |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Cooper   | 1       | 18         |
| Indie    | 0.5     | 13         |
| Kota     | 0.7     | 26         |
| Zoe      | 0.8     | 32         |
| Charley  | 1.5     | 25         |
| Ladybird | 0.6     | 20         |
| Callie   | 0.9     | 16         |
| Jaxson   | 0.4     | 19         |
| Leinni   | 1       | 25         |
| Max      | 1.6     | 65         |

## Formatting SELECT statements

This is another of those hot-button topics with software developers. Some people
like to put all the stuff on one line for each SQL keyword.

```sql
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs
FROM   puppies;
```

That works for short lists. But some tables have hundreds of columns. That gets
long.

Some developers like what you saw earlier, the "each column name on its own line
with the comma at the front".

```sql
SELECT name
     , age_yrs
     , weight_lbs
FROM   puppies;
```

They like this because if they need to comment out a column name, they can just
put a couple of dashes at the beginning of the line.

```sql
SELECT name
--     , age_yrs
     , weight_lbs
FROM   puppies;
```

Some developers just do a word wrap when lines get too long.

All of these are fine. Just stay consistent within a project how you do them.

# Selecting Table Rows Using WHERE And Common Operators

In the last reading, we learned how to create a simple SQL query using SELECT.
In this reading, we'll be adding a [WHERE clause][1] to our SELECT statement to
further filter a database table and get specific rows back.

## Using SELECT and WHERE

Previously, we covered how to use SELECT queries to fetch all of a table's rows
or specified table rows by column(s). We can filter information returned by our query by using a WHERE clause in our SELECT statement.

Let's look at some examples of adding a WHERE clause using our `puppies` table
from before:

| name     | age_yrs | breed               | weight_lbs | microchipped |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Cooper   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 18         | yes          |
| Indie    | 0.5     | Yorkshire Terrier   | 13         | yes          |
| Kota     | 0.7     | Australian Shepherd | 26         | no           |
| Zoe      | 0.8     | Korean Jindo        | 32         | yes          |
| Charley  | 1.5     | Basset Hound        | 25         | no           |
| Ladybird | 0.6     | Labradoodle         | 20         | yes          |
| Callie   | 0.9     | Corgi               | 16         | no           |
| Jaxson   | 0.4     | Beagle              | 19         | yes          |
| Leinni   | 1       | Miniature Schnauzer | 25         | yes          |
| Max      | 1.6     | German Shepherd     | 65         | no           |

### WHERE clause for a single value

The simplest WHERE clause finds a row by a single column value. See the example
below, which finds the rows where the breed equals 'Corgi':

```shell
SELECT name, breed FROM puppies
  WHERE breed = 'Corgi';
```

`SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` are capitalized. Notice that the string must use
single quotation marks. _Note: PostgreSQL converts all names of tables, columns,
functions, etc. to lowercase unless they're double quoted._ For example:
`create table Foo()` will create a table called `foo`, and `create table
"Bar"()` will create a table called `Bar`. If you use double quotation marks in
the query above, you'll get an error that says `column "Corgi" does not exist`
because it thinks you're searching for the capitalized column name `Corgi`.

Use the command `psql -U postgres` in the terminal, and type in your 'postgres'
user password to connect to the PostgreSQL server. You should have a puppies
table in your postgres database from the last reading. Once you're in psql,
enter the query above into the terminal and press Enter. You should get back one
result for Callie the Corgi.

```shell
  name  | breed
--------+-------
 Callie | Corgi
```

### WHERE clause for a list of values

We can also add a WHERE clause to check for a list of values. The syntax is
`WHERE [column] IN ('value1', 'value2', 'value3')`. Let's say we wanted to find
the name and breed of the puppies who are Corgis, Beagles, or Yorkshire
Terriers. We could do so with the query below:

```shell
SELECT name, breed FROM puppies
  WHERE breed IN ('Corgi', 'Beagle', 'Yorkshire Terrier');
```

Entering this query into psql should yield the following results:

```shell
  name  |       breed
--------+-------------------
 Indie  | Yorkshire Terrier
 Callie | Corgi
 Jaxson | Beagle
 ```

### WHERE clause for a range of values

In addition to checking for string values, we can use the WHERE clause to check
for a range of numeric/integer values. This time, let's find the name, breed,
and age of the puppies who are between 0 to 6 months old.

```shell
SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies
  WHERE age_yrs BETWEEN 0 AND 0.6;
```

Entering this query into psql should yield the following results:

```shell
   name   |       breed       | age_yrs
----------+-------------------+---------
 Indie    | Yorkshire Terrier |     0.5
 Ladybird | Labradoodle       |     0.6
 Jaxson   | Beagle            |     0.4
```

## ORDER BY

Getting the values back from a database in any order it wants to give them to
you is ludicrous. Instead, you will often want to specify the order in which
you get them back. Say you wanted them in alphabetical order by their name.
Then, you would write

```sql
SELECT name, breed
FROM puppies
ORDER BY name;
```

Say you wanted that returned from oldest dog to youngest dog. You would write

```sql
SELECT name, breed
FROM puppies
ORDER BY age_yrs DESC;
```

where `DESC` means in descending order. Note that the column that you order on
does not have to appear in the column list of the `SELECT` statement.

## LIMIT and OFFSET

Say your query would return one million rows because you've cataloged every
puppy in the world. That would be a lot for any application to handle. Instead,
you may want to limit the number of rows returned. You can do that with the
`LIMIT` keyword.

```sql
SELECT name, breed
FROM puppies
ORDER BY age_yrs
LIMIT 100;
```

That would return the name and breed of the 100 youngest puppies. (Why?) That
is, of the million rows that the statement would find, it _limits_ the number to
only 100.

Let's say you want to see the _next_ 100 puppies after the first hundred. You
can do that with the `OFFSET` keyword which comes after the `LIMIT` clause.

```sql
SELECT name, breed
FROM puppies
ORDER BY age_yrs
LIMIT 100 OFFSET 100;
```

That will return only rows 101 - 200 of the result set. It _limits_ the total
number of records to return to 100. Then, it starts at the 100th row and counts
100 records. Those are the records returned.

## SQL operators

A SQL operator is a word or character that is used inside a WHERE clause to
perform comparisons or arithmetic operations. In the three examples above, we
used SQL operators inside of WHERE clauses to filter table rows -- `=`, `IN`,
`BETWEEN`, and `AND`.

The following is a listing of SQL operators. We can combine any of these
operators in our query or use a single operator by itself.

### Logical operators

| Operator | Description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALL      | TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition.        |
| AND      | TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.         |
| ANY      | TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition.        |
| BETWEEN  | TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisons.       |
| EXISTS   | TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.             |
| IN       | TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions. |
| LIKE     | TRUE if the operand matches a pattern (accepts "wildcards").  |
| NOT      | Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.            |
| OR       | TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.        |
| SOME     | TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition.        |

Here is another example query with a WHERE clause using several logical
operators: `NOT`, `IN`, `AND`, and `LIKE`.

```shell
SELECT name, breed FROM puppies
  WHERE breed NOT IN ('Miniature Schnauzer', 'Basset Hound', 'Labradoodle')
    AND breed NOT LIKE '%Shepherd';
```

**Note**: Pay attention to that `LIKE` operator. You will use it more than you
want to. The wildcard it uses is the percent sign. Here's a table to help you
understand.

| `LIKE`    | Matches "dog" | Matches "hotdog" | Matches "dog-tired" | Matches "ordogordo" |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `'dog'`   | yes           | no               | no                  | no                  |
| `'%dog'`  | yes           | yes              | no                  | no                  |
| `'dog%'`  | yes           | no               | yes                 | no                  |
| `'%dog%'` | yes           | yes              | yes                 | yes                 |

Entering this query into psql should yield the following results:

```shell
  name  |       breed
--------+-------------------
 Indie  | Yorkshire Terrier
 Zoe    | Korean Jindo
 Callie | Corgi
 Jaxson | Beagle
```

With the query above, we filtered out six puppies: two Miniature Schnauzers, one
Basset Hound, one Labradoodle, and two Shepherds. We started with ten puppies in
the table, so we're left with four table rows. There are two puppies who are
Shepherd breeds: an Australian Shepherd and a German Shepherd. We used the
`LIKE` operator to filter these. In `'%Shepherd`, the `%` matches any substring
value before the substring 'Shepherd'.

### Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Meaning                     | Syntax |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| +        | Addition                    | a + b  |
| -        | Subtraction                 | a - b  |
| *        | Multiplication              | a * b  |
| /        | Division                    | a / b  |
| %        | Modulus (returns remainder) | a % b  |

Here is an example query with a WHERE clause using the multiplication operator
to find puppies that are 6 months old:

```shell
SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies
  WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 6;
```

Entering the above query into psql will yield one result:

```shell
   name   |    breed    | age_yrs
----------+-------------+---------
 Ladybird | Labradoodle |     0.6
```

### Comparison operators

| Operator | Meaning                  | Syntax |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| =        | Equals                   | a = b  |
| !=       | Not equal to             | a != b |
| <>       | Not equal to             | a <> b |
| >        | Greater than             | a > b  |
| <        | Less than                | a < b  |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | a >= b |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | a <= b |
| !<       | Not less than            | a !< b |
| !>       | Not greater than         | a !> b |

Here is an example query with a WHERE clause using the `>` comparison operator:

```shell
SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies
  WHERE weight_lbs > 50;
```

Entering the above query into psql will yield one result:

```shell
 name |      breed      | weight_lbs
------+-----------------+------------
 Max  | German Shepherd |         65
 ```

* How to use a WHERE clause in a SELECT query
* How to construct WHERE clauses matching a single value, a list of values, and
  a range of values

# Inserting Data Into A Table
________________________________________________________________________________

If you have data, but it’s not in tables, does the data even exist? Not to an
app! We often need to create relational databases on the back end of the Web
apps we’re building so that we can ultimately display this data on the front
end of our application. All relational database data is stored in tables, so
it’s important to learn how to create tables and successfully query them.

Of the four data manipulation statements, `INSERT` is the easiest.

Create a new database named "folks". Now, create a new table named "friends"
with the following column specifications.

| Name       | Data type      | Constraints   |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| id         | `SERIAL`       | `PRIMARY KEY` |
| first_name | `VARCHAR(255)` | `NOT NULL`    |
| last_name  | `VARCHAR(255)` | `NOT NULL`    |

Now that we have a new table, we need to add table rows with some data. We can
insert a new table row using the following syntax:

```shell
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES
  (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);
```

Let’s fill out our “friends” table with information about five friends. In
psql, enter the following to add new table rows. _Note the use of single
quotation marks for string values. Also note that, since we used the [`SERIAL`
pseudo-type][1] to auto-increment the ID values, we can simply write `DEFAULT`
for the ID values when inserting new table rows._

```shell
INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
  (DEFAULT, 'Amy', 'Pond');
```

You can also completely omit the `DEFAULT` keyword if you specify the names of
the columns that you want to insert into.

You can also use the "multiple values" insert. This prevents you from having to
write `INSERT` with every statement. Even better, if one fails, they all fail.
That can help protect your data integrity.

```
INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
('Rose', 'Tyler'),
('Martha', 'Jones'),
('Donna', 'Noble'),
('River', 'Song');
```

Use `SELECT * FROM friends;` to verify that there are rows in the “friends”
table:

```shell
appacademy=# SELECT * FROM friends;
 id | first_name | last_name
----+------------+-----------
  1 | Amy        | Pond
  2 | Rose       | Tyler
  3 | Martha     | Jones
  4 | Donna      | Noble
  5 | River      | Song
```

Now let’s try to insert a new row using the ID of 5:

```shell
INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (5, 'Jenny', 'Who');
```

Because ID is a primary key and that ID is already taken, we should get a
message in psql that it already exists:

```shell
appacademy=# insert into friends values (5, 'Jenny', 'Who');
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "friends_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(5) already exists.
```

## What we learned:

* How to connect to an existing PostgreSQL database
* How to create a new PostgreSQL database
* How to create a new database table
* Accepted PostgreSQL data types
* How to add new rows to a database table
* What a primary key is/does

# Foreign Keys And The JOIN Operation

In relational databases, _relationships_ are key. We can create relationships,
or _associations_, among tables so that they can access and share data. In a
SQL database, we create table associations through _foreign keys_ and _primary
keys_.

You've learned about primary and foreign keys. Now, it's time to put them to
use.

## Setting up the database

Create a new database called "learn_joins". Connect to that database. Run the
following SQL statements to create tables and the data in them.

```sql
CREATE TABLE breeds (
  id SERIAL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO breeds (name)
VALUES
('Australian Shepherd'),
('Basset Hound'),
('Beagle'),
('Corgi'),
('German Shepherd'),
('Korean Jindo'),
('Labradoodle'),
('Miniature Schnauzer'),
('Yorkshire Terrier');
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE puppies (
  id SERIAL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  age_yrs NUMERIC(3,1) NOT NULL,
  breed_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  weight_lbs INTEGER NOT NULL,
  microchipped BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  PRIMARY KEY(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (breed_id) REFERENCES breeds(id)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO puppies (name, age_yrs, breed_id, weight_lbs, microchipped)
VALUES
('Cooper', 1, 8, 18, true),
('Indie', 0.5, 9, 13, true),
('Kota', 0.7, 1, 26, false),
('Zoe', 0.8, 6, 32, true),
('Charley', 1.5, 2, 25, false),
('Ladybird', 0.6, 7, 20, true),
('Callie', 0.9, 4, 16, false),
('Jaxson', 0.4, 3, 19, true),
('Leinni', 1, 8, 25, true),
('Max', 1.6, 5, 65, false);
```

## Using JOIN to retrieve rows from multiple tables

Now that we’ve set up an association between the “puppies” table and the
“friends” table, we can access data from both tables. We can do so by using a
[JOIN operation][3] in our SELECT query. Type the following into psql:

```sql
SELECT * FROM puppies
INNER JOIN breeds ON (puppies.breed_id = breeds.id);
```

The `JOIN` operation above is joining the "puppies" table with the "breeds"
table together into a single table using the foreign key/primary key shared
between the two tables: `breed_id`.

You should get all rows back containing all information for the puppies and
breeds with matching `breed_id` values:

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM puppies
postgres-# INNER JOIN breeds ON (puppies.breed_id = breeds.id);
 id |   name   | age_yrs | breed_id | weight_lbs | microchipped | id |        name
----+----------+---------+----------+------------+--------------+----+---------------------
  1 | Cooper   |     1.0 |        8 |         18 | t            |  8 | Miniature Schnauzer
  2 | Indie    |     0.5 |        9 |         13 | t            |  9 | Yorkshire Terrier
  3 | Kota     |     0.7 |        1 |         26 | f            |  1 | Australian Shepherd
  4 | Zoe      |     0.8 |        6 |         32 | t            |  6 | Korean Jindo
  5 | Charley  |     1.5 |        2 |         25 | f            |  2 | Basset Hound
  6 | Ladybird |     0.6 |        7 |         20 | t            |  7 | Labradoodle
  7 | Callie   |     0.9 |        4 |         16 | f            |  4 | Corgi
  8 | Jaxson   |     0.4 |        3 |         19 | t            |  3 | Beagle
  9 | Leinni   |     1.0 |        8 |         25 | t            |  8 | Miniature Schnauzer
 10 | Max      |     1.6 |        5 |         65 | f            |  5 | German Shepherd
(10 rows)
```

We could make our query more specific by selecting specific columns, adding a
`WHERE` clause, or doing any number of operations that we could do in a normal
`SELECT` query. Aside from an `INNER JOIN`, we could also do different types of
`JOIN` operations. (Refer to this overview on [PostgreSQL JOINS][4] for more
information.)

# Writing And Running A Seed File In PSQL

After a database is created, we need to populate it, or _seed_ it, with data.
Until now, we’ve used the command-line psql interface to create tables and
insert rows into those tables. While that’s fine for small datasets, it would
be cumbersome to add a large dataset using the command line.

In this reading, we’ll learn how to create and run a seed file, which makes the
process of populating a database with test data much easier.

## Creating a seed file

You can create a seed file by opening up VSCode or any text editor and saving a
file with the `.sql` extension.

Let’s create a seed file called `seed-data.sql` that’s going to create a new
table called `pies` and insert 50 pie rows into the table. Use the code below
to create the seed file, and make sure to save your seed file on your machine.

_**seed-data.sql**_
```sql
CREATE TABLE pies (
  flavor VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  price FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Apple', 19.95);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Caramel Apple Crumble', 20.53);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Blueberry', 19.31);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Blackberry', 22.86);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Cherry', 22.32);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Peach', 20.45);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Raspberry', 20.99);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Mixed Berry', 21.45);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Strawberry Rhubarb', 24.81);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Banana Cream', 18.66);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Boston Toffee', 25.00);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Banana Nutella', 22.12);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Bananas Foster', 24.99);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Boston Cream', 23.75);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Cookies and Cream', 18.27);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Coconut Cream', 22.89);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chess', 25.00);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Lemon Chess', 25.00);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Key Lime', 19.34);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Lemon Meringue', 19.58);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Guava', 18.92);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Mango', 19.55);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Plum', 20.21);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Apricot', 20.55);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Gooseberry', 23.54);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Lingonberry', 24.35);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Pear Vanilla Butterscotch', 25.13);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Baked Alaska', 25.71);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chocolate', 19.00);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chocolate Mousse', 21.46);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Mexican Chocolate', 28.33);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chocolate Caramel', 26.67);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough', 18.65);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Pecan', 26.33);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Bourbon Caramel Pecan', 27.88);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Chocolate Pecan', 27.63);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Pumpkin', 20.91);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Sweet Potato', 20.75);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Purple Sweet Potato', 26.34);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Cheesecake', 28.99);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Butterscotch Praline', 29.78);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Salted Caramel', 30.32);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Salted Honey', 59.00);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Sugar Cream', 33.89);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Mississippi Mud', 28.67);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Turtle Fudge', 30.58);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Fruit Loops', 20.45);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Black Forest', 34.99);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Maple Cream', 35.88);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Smores', 26.43);
INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Milk Bar', 46.00);

SELECT * FROM pies;
```

## Populating a database via < (“left caret”)

Now that you have a seed file, you can insert it into a database with a
simple command.

Create a database named "bakery".

The syntax is `psql -d [database] < [path_to_file/file.sql]`. The left caret
(`<`) takes the standard input from the file on the right (your seed file) and
inputs it into the program on the left (`psql`).

Open up your terminal, and enter the following command. Make sure to replace
`path_to_my_file` with the actual file path.

```shell
psql -d bakery < path_to_my_file/seed-data.sql
```

In the terminal, you should see a bunch of `INSERT` statements and the entire
“pies” table printed out (from the `SELECT *` query in the seed file).

You can log into psql and use `\dt` to verify that your new table has been
added to the database:

```shell
postgres=# \dt
List of relations
 Schema |     Name     | Type  |  Owner
 public | breeds       | table | appacademy
 public | pies         | table | appacademy
 public | puppies      | table | appacademy
```

## Populating the database via | (“pipe”)

You could also use the “pipe” (`|`) to populate the database with your seed
file.

The syntax is `cat [path_to_file/file.sql] | psql -d [database]`. ‘cat’ is a
standard Unix utility that reads files sequentially, writing them to standard
output. The “pipe” (`|`) takes the standard output of the command on the left
and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right.

Try out this method in your terminal. If you have an existing “pies” table,
you’ll need to drop this table before you can add it again:

```sql
DROP TABLE pies;
```

Then, enter the following. Make sure to replace `path_to_my_file` with the
actual file path.

```shell
cat path_to_my_file/seed-data.sql | psql -d postgres
```

Again, you should see a bunch of `INSERT` statements and the entire “pies”
table printed out (from the `SELECT *` query in the seed file).

You can log into psql and use `\dt` to verify that your new table has been
added to the database:

```shell
postgres=# \dt
List of relations
 Schema |     Name     | Type  |  Owner
 public | friends      | table | postgres
 public | pies         | table | postgres
 public | puppies      | table | postgres
```

# Create And Seed A Database Project

In our SQL readings, we installed PostgreSQL, and we learned how to create a new
PostgreSQL database and how to create and run a seed file in our database.

In this project, you'll practice seeding your database with a seed file that's
full of, well, _seeds_! Hopefully when you're done, you'll have _grown_ your SQL
knowledge.

## Project overview

Practice creating a new database and piping a seed file into your database.

* In Phase 1, you'll create a new database.
* In Phase 2, you'll create a new seed data file.
* In Phase 3, you'll pipe your seed data in your database via `psql` on the
command line.

## Phase 1: Create a new database

First, log into `psql` on the command line as your user.

Second, create a new database in PostgreSQL called `farm` by using the following
syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [databasename];
```

_Note:_ You can check to make sure you've created a new database by viewing the
list of databases with `\l`.

## Phase 2: Create a seeds seed file

Create a seed file full of seeds! Set up a SQL file with seed data that will
produce two tables: an "edible_seeds" with 40 rows and a "flower_seeds" table
with 20 rows.

**Edible Seeds**

Use the following data types for your "flower_seeds" columns:

* id - SERIAL
* name - VARCHAR that accepts 300 characters
* main_color - VARCHAR that accepts 100 characters
* seeds_per_packet - INT
* price_per_packet - FLOAT
* in_stock - BOOLEAN

_Note:_ Make sure to save your seed file on your machine so that you can pipe it
into your database in the next phase!

## Phase 3: Pipe your seed file into your new database

After you've saved your seed file, use the caret and pipe methods to seed
your `farm` database with the data from the "edible_seeds" table. (_Note: Make
sure you've quit `psql` first with `\q`._)

There are two ways to seed your database:

### Method 1. Seed your database via caret method

```sql
psql -d [database] -U [username] < [path_to_file/file.sql]
```

### Method 2. Seed your database via pipe method

```sql
cat [path_to_file/file.sql] | psql -d [database] -U [username]
```

Try both of these methods.

### If you want to seed using the file again, you need to first drop the tables. 

Access the database by:

```sql
psql -d [database] -U [username]
```

Then drop the tables:

```sql
DROP TABLE [table];
```

Then you can run the seed file again using any of the two above methods.

### Check to make sure your seed file has actually updated the `farm` database

* Log into `psql` again.
* Connect to the `farm` database (syntax: `\c [database]`).
* Make sure your "edible_seeds" table is filled with seeds: `SELECT * FROM «table name»;`
* Make sure your "flower_seeds" table is filled with seeds: `SELECT * FROM «table name»;`

# Solving The SQL Menagerie

In our SQL readings, we learned how to write basic SQL queries and incorporate
`WHERE` clauses to filter for more specific results. We also learned how to use
a `JOIN` operation to get information from multiple tables.

In this project, put your SQL knowledge to the test and show off your querying
skills.

We've put together a collection (let's call it a _menagerie_) of SQL problems
for you to solve below. Solve them all, and you'll be the master of the
menagerie!

## Getting started

Clone the starter repository from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/sql-select-exercises-starter.

## Project overview

1. In Phase 1, pipe the seed file into a new database.
2. In Phase 2, query the seed tables with basic `SELECT` statements.
3. In Phase 3, query the seed tables using `WHERE` clauses to get more specific
   rows back.
4. In Phase 4, use a `JOIN` operation to get data from both seed tables.
5. Bonuses! Go beyond what we learned in the readings to deepen your SQL query
   knowledge.

## Phase 1: Pipe in a seed file to create new database tables

We've set up a seed file for you to use in this project called
_**cities_and_airports.sql_** that will create two tables: a "cities" table and
an "airports" table. These tables show the top 25 most populous U.S. cities and
their airports, respectively. Pipe this file into your database, and use these
tables for the rest of the project phases.

Go through the following steps:

1. Log into `psql`.
2. Create a new database called "travel".
3. Pipe the _cities_and_airports.sql_ seed file into the "travel" database.
4. Check that there's data in both the "cities" and "airports" tables.

## Phase 2: Write basic SELECT statements

Retrieve rows from a table using `SELECT` FROM SQL statements.

1. Write a SQL query that returns the city, state, and estimated population in
   2018 from the "cities" table.

2. Write a SQL query that returns all of the airport names contained in the
   "airports" table.

## Phase 3: Add WHERE clauses

Select specific rows from a table using WHERE and common operators.

1. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to get the estimated population
   in 2018 of the city of San Diego.
2. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to get the city, state, and
   estimated population in 2018 of cities in this list: Phoenix, Jacksonville,
   Charlotte, Nashville.
3. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to get the cities with an
   estimated 2018 population between 800,000 and 900,000 people. Show the city,
   state, and estimated population in 2018 columns.
4. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to get the names of the cities
   that had an estimated population in 2018 of at least 1 million people (or
   1,000,000 people).
5. Write a SQL query to get the city and estimated population in 2018 in number
   of millions (_i.e. without zeroes at the end: 1 million_), and that uses a
   `WHERE` clause to return only the cities in Texas.
6. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to get the city, state, and
   estimated population in 2018 of cities that are NOT in the following states:
   New York, California, Texas.
7. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause with the `LIKE` operator to get
   the city, state, and estimated population in 2018 of cities that start with
   the letter "S". (_Note: See the PostgreSQL doc on [Pattern Matching][1] for
   more information._)
8. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to find the cities with either
   a land area of over 400 square miles OR a population over 2 million people
   (or 2,000,000 people). Show the city name, the land area, and the estimated
   population in 2018.
9. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to find the cities with either
   a land area of over 400 square miles OR a population over 2 million people
   (or 2,000,000 people) -- but not the cities that have both. Show the city
   name, the land area, and the estimated population in 2018.
10. Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to find the cities where the
    population has increased by over 200,000 people from 2010 to 2018. Show
    the city name, the estimated population in 2018, and the census population
    in 2010.

## Phase 4: Use a JOIN operation

Retrieve rows from multiple tables joining on a foreign key.

The "airports" table has a foreign key called `city_id` that references
the `id` column in the "cities" table.

1. Write a SQL query using an INNER JOIN to join data from the "cities" table
   with data from the "airports" table using the `city_id` foreign key.
   Show the airport names and city names only.
2. Write a SQL query using an INNER JOIN to join data from the "cities" table
   with data from the "airports" table to find out how many airports are in New
   York City using the city name. (_Note: Use the [aggregate function][2]
   COUNT() to count the number of matching rows._)

## Bonuses

1. **Apostrophe:** Write a SQL query to get all three ID codes (_the Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) ID, the International Air Transport Association
   (IATA) ID, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ID_) from
   the "airports" table for Chicago O'Hare International Airport. (_Note:
   You'll need to escape the quotation mark in O'Hare.
   See [How to include a single quote in a SQL query][3]._)
2. **Formatting Commas:** Refactor Phase 2, Query #1 to turn the INT for
   estimated population in 2018 into a character string with commas.
   (_Note: See [Data Type Formatting Functions][4]_)

   * Phase 2, Query #1: Write a SQL query that returns the city, state, and
     estimated population in 2018 from the "cities" table.
3. **Decimals and Rounding:** Refactor Phase 3, Query #5 to turn number of
   millions from an integer into a decimal rounded to a precision of two decimal
   places. (_Note: See [Numeric Types][5] and the [ROUND function][6]._)

   * Phase 3, Query #5: Write a SQL query to get the city and estimated
     population in 2018 in number of millions (_i.e. without zeroes at the end:
     1 million_), and that uses a `WHERE` clause to return only the cities in Texas.
4. **ORDER BY and LIMIT Clauses:** Refactor Phase 3, Query #10 to return only
   one city with the biggest population increase from 2010 to 2018. Show the
   city name, the estimated population in 2018, and the census population in
   2010 for that city. (_Note: You'll do the same calculation as before, but
   instead of comparing it to 200,000, use the [ORDER BY Clause][7] with the
   [LIMIT][8] Clause to sort the results and grab only the top result.)
   * Phase 3, Query #10: Write a SQL query that uses a `WHERE` clause to find
     the cities where the population has increased by over 200,000 people from
     2010 to 2018. Show the city name, the estimated population in 2018, and the
     census population in 2010.
