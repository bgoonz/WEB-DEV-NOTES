You must do\nthem in order of the file name.\n\nYou'll be writing your SQL in *.sql files. This is just like writing it in the\n`psql` client. You put semicolons after each statement. But, you don't have to\nworry about silly mistakes because it's in a file and they're easy to fix.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Clone the project from\n  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/sql-database-management-starter.\n* `cd` into the project folder\n* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory\n* `npm test` to run the specs\n* You can view the test cases in `test`. Your job is to write code in\n  * **01-create-users.sql** to write statements that will create users\n  * **01-create-databases.sql** to write statements that will create databases\n  * **01-create-aa-times-tables.sql** will create related tables in a database\n"
