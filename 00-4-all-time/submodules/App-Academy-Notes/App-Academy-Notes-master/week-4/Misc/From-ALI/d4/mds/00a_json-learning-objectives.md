# JSON Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is to familiarize you with the JSON format and
how to serialize to and deserialize from that format.

**The learning objectives** for this lesson are that you can:

1. Identify and generate valid JSON-formatted strings
2. Use `JSON.parse` to deserialize JSON-formatted strings
3. Use `JSON.stringify` to serialize JavaScript objects
4. Correctly identify the definition of "deserialize"
5. Correctly identify the definition of "serialize"

**This lesson is relevant** because JSON is the _lingua franca_ of data
interchange.
