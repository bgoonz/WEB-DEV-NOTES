# ORM Learning Objectives

To ease the use of SQL, the object-relational mapping tool was invented. This
allows developers to focus on their application code and let a library generate
all of the SQL for them. Depending on which developer you ask, this is a miracle
or a travesty. Either way, those developers use them because writing all of the
SQL by hand is a chore that most software developers just don't want to do.
