# Requirement 4: Creating A New Game

In this requirement, you will now make the "New Game" button work. To do this,
you will need to perform the following:

* When the game status is not "won" or "tied", then the "New Game" button is
  disabled.
* When the game status is "won" or "tied", then the "New Game" button is
  enabled.
* When a player clicks the "New Game" button, then it
  * clears the game status,
  * clears the header,
  * clears the board, and
  * makes it so the next click of the tic-tac-toe board is an "X"
  * (disables the "New Game" button)

During development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.
