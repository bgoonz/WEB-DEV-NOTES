In our SQL readings, we installed PostgreSQL, and we learned how to create a new
PostgreSQL database and how to create and run a seed file in our database.

In this project, you'll practice seeding your database with a seed file that's
full of, well, _seeds_! Hopefully when you're done, you'll have _grown_ your SQL
knowledge.

## Project overview

Practice creating a new database and piping a seed file into your database.

* In Phase 1, you'll create a new database.
* In Phase 2, you'll create a new seed data file.
* In Phase 3, you'll pipe your seed data in your database via `psql` on the
command line.

## Phase 1: Create a new database

First, log into `psql` on the command line as your user.

Second, create a new database in PostgreSQL called `farm` by using the following
syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [databasename];
```

_Note:_ You can check to make sure you've created a new database by viewing the
list of databases with `\l`.

## Phase 2: Create a seeds seed file

Create a seed file full of seeds! Set up a SQL file with seed data that will
produce two tables: an "edible_seeds" with 40 rows and a "flower_seeds" table
with 20 rows.

Use the following data types for your "flower_seeds" columns:

* id - SERIAL
* name - VARCHAR that accepts 300 characters
* main_color - VARCHAR that accepts 100 characters
* seeds_per_packet - INT
* price_per_packet - FLOAT
* in_stock - BOOLEAN

_Note:_ Make sure to save your seed file on your machine so that you can pipe it
into your database in the next phase!

## Phase 3: Pipe your seed file into your new database

After you've saved your seed file, use the caret and pipe methods to seed
your `farm` database with the data from the "edible_seeds" table. (_Note: Make
sure you've quit `psql` first with `\q`._)

There are two ways to seed your database:

### Method 1. Seed your database via caret method

```sql
psql -d [database] -U [username] < [path_to_file/file.sql]
```

### Method 2. Seed your database via pipe method

```sql
cat [path_to_file/file.sql] | psql -d [database] -U [username]
```

Try both of these methods.

### If you want to seed using the file again, you need to first drop the tables. 

Access the database by:

```sql
psql -d [database] -U [username]
```

Then drop the tables:

```sql
DROP TABLE [table];
```

Then you can run the seed file again using any of the two above methods.

### Check to make sure your seed file has actually updated the `farm` database

* Log into `psql` again.
* Connect to the `farm` database (syntax: `\c [database]`).
* Make sure your "edible_seeds" table is filled with seeds: `SELECT * FROM «table name»;`
* Make sure your "flower_seeds" table is filled with seeds: `SELECT * FROM «table name»;`
